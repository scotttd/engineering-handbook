## Team Organization {#team-organization}

We use two levels of team organization for the build season. The Team is broken down into Sub-Assembly teams. Depending on the challenge each year, subassemblies could include, plus some required:

*   Shooter
*   Collector
*   Chassis/Bumpers
*   Hopper
*   End Game/Special Development
*   Ad hoc sub-teams
    *   Field build and Practice organization
    *   Driver Station
    *   Competition - Pit
    *   Buttons
    *   T-shirts
    *   Web
    *   Daily game strategy
    *   Drivers
    *   Outreach

Each of these teams would best be served if they contain Cross-Functional Disciplines including:

*   Programming
*   Fabrication
*   Electrical
*   Marketing
