## Forming Sub-Assembly Teams {#forming-sub-assembly-teams}

*   Cross functional - It is preferred all teams have programmers, fabricators, electrical engineers, CAD designers, etc.
*   Team size - Teams should be roughly the same size. Ideal size might be 5-7 members for a sub assembly.
*   Teams should be self forming.
*   Team formation happens in two stages. At the start of the first week, teams will self select into design teams. Each of these teams will develop and present robot designs by the end of the week. At the end of design week, those same teams will be assigned a sub-assembly to lead.
*   Lead engineers are elected by the teams at the end of design week.
