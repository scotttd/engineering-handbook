## Work Session Attendance {#work-session-attendance}

Timely attendance is required to build days. Attendance is important and you should enter your work session attendance here [Work Session Attendance](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApHhc6Jj0u02dHpXNzZRTFBCSGxqZVhLMWd0enJZc1E&usp=drive_web#gid=2). Those late or not present will not be counted as in attendance for that day.

For those that have not been in attendance for more than a day during build time should understand that things have moved past their expectations(mentor and student) and should check in with their lead engineer and other mentors to be brought up to speed.
