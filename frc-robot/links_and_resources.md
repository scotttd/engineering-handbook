This is the key community to learn and understand the world of FRC Robotics. Very helpful and key to understanding all the new developments in FRC. Become a member here, read what others are saying. Even the most experienced can learn from Chief Delphi.

[WPI](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485)

This is the source of instructions for software development tools and tutorials. Step by step instructions to get both the driver station and compilers set up for all languages.

Source for 2015 FRC tools update and tutorials

[Complete Idiot&#039;s Guide to FRC](http://hcwilson.weebly.com/uploads/3/8/4/6/38463501/frc_guide_-_arpan_rao.pdf)

A good presentation on the important concepts of robot design

[FRC Designs](http://frcdesigns.com/)

After years of FRC, it is likely the current game is similar to a previous game. Do your homework, learn what was successful previously. This is a wonderful website full of complete robot designs from previous years.

[Team 358 Documentation](http://www.team358.org/)

This teams has some amazing documentation on all aspects of an FRC team with great tip and practical experiences. (The site mysteriously went offline in early 2016\. Hopefully only temporarily.)

[AndyMark](http://www.andymark.com/)

One of the two main suppliers to FRC robotics. AndyMark is actively engaged each year in bringing the best and newest technology to FRC robotics. Become familiar with what is available here. Be aware of the new products they introduce each year. Many times the parts that are introduced a week or two before the season will be key to this year&#039;s game.

[VexPro](http://www.vexrobotics.com/vexpro/)

VexPro is the FRC series of part and systems from Vex Robotics. The Vexpro series of parts are excellent and well thought out systems to build FRC robots. Many of the mechanical systems are based off VexPro systems.
