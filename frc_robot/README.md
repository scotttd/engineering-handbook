# The Anatomy of a FRC competition Robot {#the-anatomy-of-a-frc-competition-robot}

While the FRC Game changes each year, because of physical requirements and similar hardware year to year, FRC robots have many similar sub-systems year to year. Understanding the subsystems that make-up most robots will help guide the team on both design and fabrication. There are certain practices that are found in most successful robots.

What is a successful robot? Good question. A good robot is a robot that can play the complete game well. There are multiple tasks in most robot games. The successful robots are ones that can take care of any of the tasks well. Single task robots can be useful and are simpler to build. But as the games are played, a robot that is good at all the tasks will be able to compliment and even carry an alliance through a game. Scoring High, being able to collect a game piece and score points in autonomous can take you a long way.

What is the difference between a good and a great robot. The difference is ruggedness. The FRC season may include 64+ competition matches + practice time. A great robot will hold together through the rigors that come from this many matches. THis manual is focused on building great robots.

Each year the FRC game manual will specify limits on the size and construction of the robot. Read the Game Manual very carefully! Each rule in the manual is put there for a reason. Each rule removed any one year, is also removed for very specific reasons. We can learn as much from the rules that are there as we do from the rules that are not there.
