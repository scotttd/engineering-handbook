## [Rivet vs Welding](#rivet-vs-welding) {#rivet-vs-welding}

It seems that properly riveted parts are more durable than welding aluminum. This can serve as a replacement for welding. Proper Rivets may take more time then welding, but welds can be brittle and are difficult on aluminium.

With a proper rivet an assembly can take a lot of abuses without loosening.
