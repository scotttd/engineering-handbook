# Structure {#structure}

Based on the team&#039;s experience and available techniques for fabrication. We are using a standardised fabrication process of Aluminum tubing with gussets and rivets to create rigid frames. This methods of fabrication also can be prototyped quickly using wood members, plywood gussets and wood screws.

While we use rivets and gussets for rigid frame structure, we also find we use bolts to generally attach sub-systems to each other. For instance it is normal to bolt the main structure to the chassis frame. This way the structure can be removed. Or bolts are used to attach the shooter to the frame.

Some examples of the rigid frames. Also notice that many of the structures use a “two rail” concept. This is because all axles should be supported on both sides leading to many dual rail configurations.

You can use this method to create 3D dimension frames and accurate angles:
