# Bumpers {#bumpers}

The 2016 bumpers were near perfect bumpers for the team. We created reversible bumpers with mitered corners.

We used the a reversable [http://kbots.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/kbotics-reversible-bumper.pdf](http://kbots.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/kbotics-reversible-bumper.pdf) . We have a modified pattern from this document. See below.

The rules normally require ¾” plywood to back the bumpers. Be aware that lightweight plywood is available. By using lighter plywood, 2.6 lbs can be saved on the overall weight of the robot.

Instead of creating full bumpers all the way along the side of the robot. You can do corner, mitered bumpers and attach them to the corners of the robot. Based on the 2013 rules, if the gap between the corner bumpers is less than 8” you are good. The corner bumpers may be easier because the exact length of the bumpers are not as critical. When doing full length bumpers, getting them to match at the corners correctly can be difficult.

The pattern for the Bumper material looks like:
